## How to run the web properly?
Use two terminal:

1. Get API access from Henry or Edmund (only once)
   - to configure API access within the backend you will have to make a file called "config.env" and put the access token, refresh token, and MongoDB database within the back-end/ folder
   - to configure API access within the frontend you will have to make a file called ".env" and put the firebase storage bucket APIs within the front-end/ folder
2. CD into chop-recipes-web/back-end
   - run `npm install`
3. CD into chop-recipes-web/front-end
   - run `npm install`
5. run `npm start` in the **back-end** folder
